CNN and tensorflow based projects use tf.contrib which is no longer supported in TF 2.x
so have to create a virtual environment of python 3.6 named DLP36 and install tensorflow 1.2.1 in it 

conda install -n DLP36 -c conda-forge tensorflow=1.2.1

# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate DLP36
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
